**#Step 1: Load the file**
Open the MEGA software.
Click on Align > Edit/Build Alignment.
In the Alignment Explorer, click Create a New Alignment and choose DNA.
Click File > Open and load your FASTA file.

#Step 2: Perform Multiple Sequence Alignment
In the Alignment Explorer, click Alignment > Align by ClustalW or Align by Muscle.
Save the aligned file:
Click Data > Export Alignment > MEGA Format (.meg).
Save as aligned_sequences.meg.

#Step 3: Construct the phylogenetic tree
In MEGAâ€™s main window, go to Phylogeny > Construct/Test Phylogeny.
Open the aligned_sequences.meg file.
Choose a tree-building method:
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) (In case of large datasets)
Maximum Likelihood (ML) (For moderate size datasets (100-1000))
Maximum Parsimony (MP) 
UPGMA 
Select Bootstrap value (100)

Click Compute to generate the tree.

#Step 4: Visualize and Save the phylogenetic tree.
The tree will be displayed with branch lengths and bootstrap values.
Customize:
Labels: Click View > Options > Font & Label Settings.
Branch Styles: Change color, width, etc.

#Step 5: Save the tree:
File > Export as Image (PNG, SVG, PDF)

#Step 6: Interpret the phylogenetic tree
Closer branches = More related species.
Bootstrap values (>70) indicate strong similarity.
